MoE System: Comprehensive Implementation and Extensibility Plan

1. Overview

The MoE (Mixture of Experts) system is designed to dynamically coordinate multiple AI models across hierarchical layers to handle tasks ranging from simple queries to complex multi-step operations. The system features:
	•	Camina (Primary Agent):
	•	Model: Mistral-22B
	•	Role: High-level orchestration, task decomposition, user interaction, and result synthesis.
	•	Belters (Domain Specialists):
	•	Model: Mistral-7B
	•	Role: Manage domain-specific tasks (research, property analysis, document creation, etc.), decompose tasks further, and coordinate execution.
	•	Drummers (Task Executors):
	•	Model: LLaMA-3.2-3B
	•	Role: Execute fine-grained tasks such as web searches, data analysis, and content generation.
	•	DeepSeek Observer:
	•	Model: DeepSeek-R1-14B
	•	Role: Oversee system performance, provide meta-analysis, and offer real-time strategic insights.

This plan outlines the system’s architectural vision, component interactions, communication layers, and guidelines for adding new tools and models while ensuring robust operational practices.

2. System Architecture

2.2 Core Components

Communication and Routing Layer
	•	Architecture:
	•	Asynchronous message passing using HTTP endpoints, gRPC, or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ/Kafka).
	•	Correlation IDs: Every task is tagged with a unique ID for traceability across layers.
	•	Routing Mechanism:
	•	A SmartRouter maps tasks to the correct Belters based on task context and capability requirements.
	•	Fallback & Retry Logic: Implement exponential backoff and alternate routing if an agent fails.

Tool and API Integration
	•	Tool Management:
	•	Dynamic Discovery: A plugin system scans a tools directory and registers tools automatically.
	•	Capability Matching: Tools declare their capabilities using standardized JSON Schema or Pydantic models.
	•	API Abstraction:
	•	Develop adapter layers that abstract common API tasks: authentication, error handling, response parsing, and logging.
	•	Centralize configuration to control API keys, endpoints, and rate limiting.

Model Registration and Configuration
	•	Configuration Files:
	•	Use YAML (or JSON) for registering models (e.g., config/models.yaml) and tools (config/tools.yaml).
	•	Modelfiles:
	•	Each model includes system prompts, parameter definitions, and response formats.
	•	Support dynamic reloading so new models or updates are incorporated without major code changes.

3. Interaction Patterns

3.1 User Interfaces

Command-Line Interface (CLI)
	•	Interactive Mode:
	•	Direct queries to Camina, Belters, Drummers, or Observer.
	•	Commands such as:
	•	camina <query>
	•	belter <task>
	•	drummer <subtask>
	•	observer <status>
	•	Batch Mode:
	•	Execute pre-defined tasks or scripts.

API Integration
	•	RESTful API:
	•	Provide endpoints for external applications.
	•	Use structured JSON for input and output.
	•	Python Client Library:
	•	Example:

from moe.client import MoEClient

client = MoEClient()
response = await client.execute_task(task_type="research", content={
    "query": "Emerging trends in renewable energy",
    "depth": "comprehensive",
    "include": ["academic", "news", "analysis"]
})
print(response)



Web Interface (Planned)
	•	Dashboard:
	•	Real-time visualization of task progress, logs, and metrics.
	•	Interactive elements such as progress bars, charts, and maps.
	•	Launch Command:
	•	python -m moe.web
	•	Accessible at http://localhost:7000.

3.2 Task Types and Execution Patterns

General Queries
	•	Purpose:
	•	Factual lookups, explanations, and simple questions.
	•	Flow:
	•	Routed directly to Camina for rapid response.

Research Tasks
	•	Purpose:
	•	Comprehensive academic, market, or technology research.
	•	Flow:
	•	Camina delegates to a Research Belter, which coordinates a swarm of Drummers.
	•	Aggregation and quality control are managed before reporting the final answer.

Analysis Tasks
	•	Purpose:
	•	Data analysis, property evaluation, and financial computations.
	•	Flow:
	•	Domain-specific Belters manage decomposition.
	•	Drummers execute numerical and data-processing subtasks.
	•	Observer monitors and provides real-time adjustments if needed.

Content Creation & Integration Tasks
	•	Purpose:
	•	Generate documents, reports, summaries, and integrate external APIs.
	•	Flow:
	•	Delegated by Document or Knowledge Belters.
	•	Drummers handle generation, formatting, and validation.
	•	Camina synthesizes the final output for user delivery.

4. Extensibility and Plugin Architecture

4.1 Adding New Tools

Step 1: Create a New Tool Module
	•	File Structure:
	•	moe/tools/<category>/your_tool.py
	•	Example Code:

from moe.tools.base import BaseTool

class YourTool(BaseTool):
    """YourTool: A tool for specialized operations."""

    async def execute(self, params: dict) -> dict:
        # 1. Validate input parameters
        # 2. Initialize resources or API connections
        # 3. Execute the task logic
        # 4. Format and return the result
        return {"result": "Output from YourTool"}



Step 2: Register the Tool in Configuration
	•	Configuration File (config/tools.yaml):

your_tool:
  category: your_category
  capabilities:
    - capability_1
    - capability_2
  parameters:
    param1: str
    param2: int



4.2 Adding New Models

Step 1: Create a Modelfile
	•	File Location:
	•	moe/models/your_model.moe
	•	Example File:

FROM base_model:version

SYSTEM """Your system prompt for your_model.
Define the role, context, and task-specific instructions here."""

PARAMETER request {
    type: string
    description: "User query or command"
    required: true
}

RESPONSE_FORMAT {
    type: object
    properties: {
        result: "string",
        error: "string"
    }
}



Step 2: Register the Model
	•	Configuration File (config/models.yaml):

your_model:
  type: belter  # Options: belter, drummer, observer, etc.
  base: base_model:version
  port: 6xxx
  capabilities:
    - capability_1
    - capability_2



4.3 Plugin and Extension Points
	•	Dynamic Discovery:
	•	Implement a plugin loader that scans moe/tools/ and moe/models/ at startup.
	•	Register discovered modules in the central registry.
	•	Standardized Interfaces:
	•	Define abstract base classes for Tools and Models to ensure consistent API methods.
	•	Configuration-Driven Behavior:
	•	Use environment variables and centralized configuration files to adjust module behavior without code changes.

5. Operational Considerations

5.1 Communication and Reliability
	•	Asynchronous Messaging:
	•	Choose between HTTP, gRPC, or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ/Kafka) to connect agents.
	•	Correlation IDs:
	•	Tag every request with a unique ID for traceability across Camina, Belters, Drummers, and Observer.
	•	Error Handling & Retry Logic:
	•	Implement exponential backoff strategies for transient failures.
	•	Define fallback routes in the SmartRouter for failed agent responses.

5.2 Monitoring and Metrics
	•	Centralized Logging:
	•	Use structured logging (e.g., JSON logs) with correlation IDs.
	•	Integrate logs with a centralized dashboard (e.g., ELK stack).
	•	Performance Metrics:
	•	Track latency, throughput, token usage, and operational cost.
	•	Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
	•	Health Checks:
	•	Implement periodic health checks for each service endpoint.
	•	Auto-restart or reassign tasks in the event of agent failures.

5.3 Security and Access Control
	•	API Authentication:
	•	Require API keys or OAuth tokens for external access.
	•	Rate Limiting:
	•	Enforce rate limits on API endpoints to protect system resources.
	•	Input Validation:
	•	Use JSON Schema or Pydantic models to validate all incoming requests.
	•	Credential Management:
	•	Securely store API keys and secrets using Vault or a similar service.
