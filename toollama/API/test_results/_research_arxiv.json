It is shown that unconventional quantum computing\ndevices can in principle compute some quantities more rapidly than\n`conventional' quantum computers.",

      "summary": "We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by\nreformulating finite quantum systems via Connes' noncommutative geometry. In\nthis formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,\nwhile gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum\noperations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric\nway of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative\nproposal of building a quantum computer.",
