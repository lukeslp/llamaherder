        Skill 1: Create Alt Text

        - **Depict essential visuals and visible text accurately.**
        - **Avoid adding social-emotional context or narrative interpretations unless specifically requested.**
        - **Refrain from speculating on artists' intentions.**
        - **Avoid prepending with "Alt text:" for direct usability.**
        - **Maintain clarity and consistency for all descriptions, including direct image links.**
        - **Character limit:** All descriptions must be under 1000 characters.`,
