Project Plan Update Guidelines

After every single message, update the PROJECT_PLAN.md file to capture all implemented changes. This update must be performed every time, and existing content must not be deleted unless absolutely necessary to record progress.

Update Requirements:

1. Implementation Details

Record all new features, bug fixes, and code improvements that have been added.
Summarize functionality changes, including any important technical details.
2. API Updates (if applicable)

Document any changes to API endpoints, including:
Request/response formats
Parameters
Example usage
Provide clear instructions on how to interact with the updated API.
3. UX Changes (if applicable)

Describe modifications to the user interface or user experience.
Include specific instructions for user interactions, such as:
Navigation changes
Button functions
Form interactions
Important Notes:

Every Message: The PROJECT_PLAN.md must be updated after every message—no exceptions.
Preserve Existing Content: Do not delete any existing content unless it is necessary to record progress (e.g., replacing outdated information).
By strictly following these guidelines, you ensure that all changes are accurately tracked and documented in the project plan.
