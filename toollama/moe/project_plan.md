# Project Plan: Developing Caminaå MoE System

## Overview

The goal is to build a comprehensive Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) system—Caminaå—that leverages multiple specialized models:
- **Caminaå (Coordinator):** Based on `mistral-small:22b`
- **Belters (File Manipulation Agents):** Based on `mistral:7b`
- **Drummers (Information Gathering Agents):** Based on `mistral:7b`
- **DeepSeek Reasoner (Background Agent):** Based on `deepseek-r1:7b`

Caminaå coordinates task execution by interpreting user queries, consulting DeepSeek for background reasoning, and delegating sub-tasks to the specialized agents (Belters and Drummers).

## Milestones & Timeline

### Phase 1: Requirements & Architecture (Weeks 1-2)
- **Define Use Cases:** Establish detailed requirements and scenarios for Caminaå.
- **Architectural Design:** Draft the high-level system architecture and define communication protocols (e.g., REST APIs, message queues) and data formats (JSON, YAML).
- **Tool & Library Selection:** Identify the necessary tools, libraries, and model dependencies.
- **Documentation Setup:** Prepare initial documentation (README, project_plan.md) and repository structure.

### Phase 2: Environment Setup & Model Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- **Development Environment:** Set up local and staging environments and configure CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
- **Model Integration:** 
  - Load and test `mistral-small:22b` for Caminaå.
  - Load and test `mistral:7b` for Belters and Drummers.
  - Validate basic inference with `deepseek-r1:7b`.
- **Server Setup:** Create and verify basic server endpoints for each agent.

### Phase 3: Module Development (Weeks 5-8)
- **Caminaå (Coordinator Module):**
  - Develop task parsing and delegation logic.
  - Integrate consultation with DeepSeek to refine task planning.
- **Belters Module:**
  - Implement file manipulation functionalities.
  - Develop an interface for receiving and executing file-related commands.
- **Drummers Module:**
  - Build information gathering routines.
  - Create communication protocols to deliver gathered data back to Caminaå.
- **Standardization:** Ensure consistent communication interfaces and error-handling patterns across all modules.

### Phase 4: Integration & Communication Framework (Weeks 9-10)
- **Inter-Agent Communication:**
  - Implement APIs or messaging systems to enable dynamic interactions among agents.
  - Establish protocols for task delegation, status updates, and result aggregation.
- **Coordination Logic:** Develop the orchestration framework that enables Caminaå to consult DeepSeek and dispatch tasks to Belters and Drummers.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Integrate logging mechanisms to trace task flows and monitor agent interactions.

### Phase 5: Testing, Debugging & Optimization (Weeks 11-12)
- **Unit Testing:** Write and run tests for individual components.
- **Integration Testing:** Validate the end-to-end workflow, ensuring robust task delegation and result synthesis.
- **Performance Optimization:** Profile inter-agent communication and model inference times; optimize as necessary.
- **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate iterative feedback from test runs to refine coordination and error handling.

### Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment (Weeks 13-14)
- **Documentation:** Finalize all repository documentation (README, API docs, in-line comments).
- **Deployment:** 
  - Prepare deployment scripts and containerization (e.g., Docker).
  - Deploy the system to staging, then production servers.
- **Final Testing:** Conduct end-to-end tests in the deployed environment.

### Phase 7: Future Enhancements (Ongoing)
- **Iterative Improvements:** Continuously gather and incorporate user feedback.
- **Feature Extensions:** Consider integrating additional specialized agents or new tools based on emerging requirements.
- **Scalability & Security:** Enhance system scalability and secure communications across all modules.

## Key Dependencies & Resources

- **Model Files:** Ensure access to and proper licensing for `mistral-small:22b`, `mistral:7b`, and `deepseek-r1:7b`.
- **Programming & Libraries:** Python 3.8+, Flask/FastAPI, PyTorch/TensorFlow (depending on model requirements), and pytest.
- **Infrastructure:** Development and staging servers, CI/CD systems, and secure API gateways.

---

## Risk Management

- **Integration Challenges:** Regularly test each integration point to catch issues early.
- **Communication Overhead:** Optimize API calls and consider asynchronous processing where applicable.
- **Model Compatibility:** Monitor for any incompatibilities between models and adjust configurations promptly.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Validate all inputs and enforce secure communication protocols.

## Next Steps

1. **Review & Approve the Plan:** Align on milestones, roles, and responsibilities.
2. **Set Up Repository & Environment:** Establish the repository structure and configure the development environment.
3. **Begin Phase 1 Activities:** Schedule regular sync meetings to monitor progress.
4. **Document Iteratively:** Update this project plan and associated documentation as development progresses.
