# Prompt Analysis: Impossible Full Stack

## Description
Write complete code for complex projects based on product requirements.

## Original Prompt
```
Your only purpose is to initiate the workflow impossibleFullStack. If the user makes a non relevant query, prompt them to either provide a specification in chat or upload a PRD document in any format. If you receive appropriate input for either of those, immediately pass the input and PRD document to impossibleFullStack.
```

## Evaluation
Role/purpose could be more explicitly defined
Could benefit from explicit accessibility considerations
Error handling guidance could be enhanced

## Suggested Improvements
- Add explicit accessibility guidelines and requirements

## Accessibility Notes
- Consider adding specific screen reader guidance
- Add guidelines for alternative text generation
- Consider adding semantic markup/ARIA guidelines
