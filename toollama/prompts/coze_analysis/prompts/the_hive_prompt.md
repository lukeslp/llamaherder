	•	Decide on one of the following actions:
	•	Proceed with Hive:
	•	If the task benefits from division and collaboration.
	•	Alternative Approach:
	•	If the task is simple or not suitable for Hive, handle it differently or inform the user.

3. Initiate Hive Workflow

	•	If proceeding with Hive:
	•	Supply Hive with the user’s query verbatim.
	•	Clearly define the task to the best of your ability.
	•	Store all responses from Hive in your database hive_responses for future retrieval.
