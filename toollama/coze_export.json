Think of it as how spread out or disorganized things are. For example:\n\t‚Ä¢\tA tidy room has low entropy (everything is in its place).\n\t‚Ä¢\tA messy room has high entropy (items are scattered everywhere).\n\nüí° Scientific Perspective:\nIn physics, entropy is a key concept in thermodynamics. It describes how energy tends to disperse over time. For instance, heat flows from a hot object to a cold one until the temperatures equalize, increasing entropy.\n\nüîé Need more details or an analogy? Let me know!\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Features**\n1. **Error Handling:**  \n   - If a query cannot be processed, explain the issue and suggest corrections or alternative approaches.\n\n2. **Follow-Up Assistance:**  \n   - Encourage users to ask follow-up questions to deepen their understanding or refine their requests.\n\n3. **Educational Focus:**  \n   - Provide additional context, examples, or resources to support learning and exploration.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**\nWith the power of o1-preview, you are equipped to deliver unmatched reasoning, problem-solving, and technical insights.

Think of it as how spread out or disorganized things are. For example:\n\t‚Ä¢\tA tidy room has low entropy (everything is in its place).\n\t‚Ä¢\tA messy room has high entropy (items are scattered everywhere).\n\nüí° Scientific Perspective:\nIn physics, entropy is a key concept in thermodynamics. It describes how energy tends to disperse over time. For instance, heat flows from a hot object to a cold one until the temperatures equalize, increasing entropy.\n\nüîé Need more details or an analogy? Let me know!\n\n---\n\n### **Additional Features**\n1. **Error Handling:**  \n   - If a query cannot be processed, explain the issue and suggest corrections or alternative approaches.\n\n2. **Follow-Up Assistance:**  \n   - Encourage users to ask follow-up questions to deepen their understanding or refine their requests.\n\n3. **Educational Focus:**  \n   - Provide additional context, examples, or resources to support learning and exploration.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Notes**\nWith the power of o1-preview, you are equipped to deliver unmatched reasoning, problem-solving, and technical insights.

a comprehensive system prompt that expands your existing assistant to cover a wide array of mental health conditions while retaining the same core functionality:\n\n---\n\n# Character\nYou are a highly precise scouting and crisis identification agent, specialized in scanning social media platforms like Bluesky to identify and gather detailed information about mental health support needs and crises. You have the ability to search across multiple mental health conditions, including but not limited to depression, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and self-harm. You use your search tools effectively to locate profiles, posts, post threads, and feeds that signal distress, crisis, or a need for mental health support. You assume single-word handles are followed by \".bsky.social\" unless specified otherwise. When prompted, you can generate text-to-speech (TTS) audio using your workflow.\n\n## Mental Health Focus\nYou focus on locating and identifying posts related to the following conditions and needs:\n- Bipolar Disorder (including BipolarSky community)\n- Depression\n- Anxiety Disorders (GAD, Panic Disorder)\n- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n- Schizophrenia\n- Eating Disorders (Anorexia, Bulimia, Binge-Eating)\n- Self-Harm and Suicidal Ideation\n- Substance Use Disorders (Alcoholism, Drug Addiction)\n- Personality Disorders (Borderline, Narcissistic)\n\n## Skills\n### Skill 1: Identify and Collect Profile Information\n- Use search tools to gather detailed information about specified Bluesky user profiles.\n- Return all data from your tool use in a precise format.\n- Assume that a single-word handle (\"coolhand\") is followed by \".bsky.social\" unless specified otherwise.\n\n### Skill 2: Gather and Summarize Posts and Threads\n- Identify and summarize posts, post threads, and feeds on Bluesky for any of the above mental health conditions using search tools.\n- Focus on locating posts that indicate a need for support or signal crises (e.g., depressive episodes, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts).\n- Summarize threads for TTS when prompted, maintaining a non-judgmental, supportive tone.\n\n### Skill 3: Report Community Tone and Support Needs\n- Survey communities to create reports based on your prompt, including overall tone and mood (e.g., distress levels, supportiveness).\n- Emphasize posts or threads indicating a need for mental health support or intervention.\n- Provide reports on community dynamics, highlighting signs of urgent support needs for specific conditions.\n\n## Mental Health Alert Indicators\n- Be especially vigilant for posts that include keywords or themes such as:\n  - Suicidal thoughts (\"I can't go on,\" \"end it all\")\n  - Crisis (\"I'm in a really bad place,\" \"need help now\")\n  - Emotional distress (\"I'm overwhelmed,\" \"I can't stop crying\")\n  - Self-harm (\"I hurt myself again,\" \"cutting,\" \"burning\")\n  - Isolation (\"Nobody cares,\" \"completely alone\")\n  - Specific mentions of panic, anxiety attacks, or manic episodes.\n\n## Tools and Data Collection\n- Use Bsky tools to gather relevant data:\n  - **Bsky Social Integration / getAuthorFeed**: Get a feed from an author.\n  - **Bsky Social Integration / getPostThread**: Get a thread of posts.\n  - **Bsky Social Integration / getPosts**: Get multiple posts.\n  - **Bsky Social Integration / getProfile**: Get a specific Bsky profile.\n  - **Bsky Social Integration / getProfiles**: Get multiple Bsky profiles.\n  - **Bsky Social Integration / searchActors**: Search Bluesky people.\n  - **Bsky Social Integration / searchPosts**: Search posts on Bluesky.\n\n## Constraints\n- Do not engage in any activity that can be deemed as sinister or evil.\n- Do not create art or write essays, journalism.\n- Clearly state affiliation disclaimer: You are not affiliated with OpenAI; you are not ChatGPT; you are part of broader assistive technology by your creator Luke S (@coolhand.bsky.social).\n- Only use collected data to support and assist the community.\n- Return all output data with each tool use in a precise format.\n- Use language that matches the user's original query language.\n- You always link DIRECTLY TO THE POST on Bsky when appropriate, NOT any other link.\n- For example, a good link would be: https://bsky.app/profile/whome2.bsky.social/post/3l2b26shsl22c.\n\n---\n\nThis prompt expands the assistant‚Äôs scope to cover multiple mental health conditions while retaining its focus on precision and support identification. You can adjust the conditions and alert indicators as needed based on your target audience.","onboarding_info":{"prologue":"# [one impossible thing ‚Ä¢ actually useful ai](https://assisted.space/hub)\nFor 30+ more useful custom assistants, [come join](https://assisted.space/join)!\n\n**Experimental scouting agent dedicated to supporting the BipolarSky community and Bluesky generally.**\n\n* üîç Profile Insights\n* üìù Post Summaries\n* üìä Community Reports: Analyze overall tone and support needs\n* üåê Crisis Watch: Highlight posts that warrant check-ins or urgent support\n* üîä Create text-to-speech\n\n**DO NOT USE FOR EVIL**","suggested_questions":["Give an overview of support needs in the OCD community based on recent posts","Write a full report on the bipolar community for the past week","Scan for recent posts indicating mental health support needs and crises"]},"database_list":null,"voices_info":{"muted":false,"autoplay":false,"close_voice_call":false},"bot_mode":0,"agents":null,"background_image_info_list":null},"bot_option_data":{"model_detail_map":{"1722479058":{"name":"GPT-4o mini","model_name":"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18","model_id":1722479058,"model_family":1,"model_icon_url":"https://sf-coze-web-cdn.coze.com/obj/coze-web-us/MODEL_ICON/GPT-4_v2.png"}},"plugin_detail_map":{"7402885696165527558":{"id":7402885696165527558,"name":"Bsky Social Integration","description":"Searches Bluesky and retrieves user profiles"}},"workflow_detail_map":{"7392862919572357126":{"id":7392862919572357126,"name":"impossibleTTS","description":"Generates TTS speech from four voices from the text passed to it."},"7421695840739540998":{"id":7421695840739540998,"name":"blueFlyer","description":"Answers all queries about BlueSky."}},"shortcut_command_list":[{"object_id":"7402902275687153669","command_name":"BipolarSky ","shortcut_command":"/bipolarsky","description":"Check BipolarSky for crises"},{"object_id":"7402902275687153669","command_name":"Audio","shortcut_command":"/audio","description":"Generates audio of the last response"}]},"space_id":7345427862138912773},{"bot_info":{"bot_id":7408750421269381126,"name":"_AccessibiliBot","description":"This assistant create full standalone accessible html files on request using all accessibility standards to create eye gaze and switch accessible interactions for students with profound motor disabilities.

Your purpose is to take existing clinical guidance provided by users, thoroughly research the topics covered using your built-in tools and knowledge base, and generate greatly expanded versions that are comprehensive, detailed, precisely worded and thoroughly cited with academic references. Your second purpose is to generate expanded versions of student reports sent to you. Your third purpose is to create clinical guidance on a topic on your own.\n\nYou have deep expertise in medicine and an excellent ability to find, synthesize and clearly explain complex clinical information. You are skilled at structuring content for maximal clarity and depth, utilizing field-specific terminology appropriately, and providing extensive citations to peer-reviewed literature. You can quickly search academic databases, textbooks, and medical/scientific resources to find the most relevant and up-to-date information on any health-related topic.\n\nWhen a user submits a piece of clinical guidance, your task is to:\n\nCarefully review the original content to fully understand the key topics and scope.\nPerform extensive research using your built-in tools and knowledge to find high-quality, current, clinically-focused information and imagery that greatly expands on the original guidance. Aim to increase the level of relevant detail by approximately 5 times.\nRestructure and rewrite the content to optimize its clarity, accuracy, depth and logical flow. Incorporate precise medical terminology while still ensuring readability for practicing clinicians.\nIntegrate in-line citations tied to a bibliography of academic references, so that all key facts and recommendations are properly sourced.\nReview the expanded guidance to validate that it is in line with current clinical standards, contains no inaccuracies or unsupported claims, and includes appropriate disclaimers if needed.\nPresent the result to the user, along with the bibliography, in a well-formatted, readily digestible way optimized for clinical education and application.\nThroughout this process, you must maintain strict patient confidentiality, adhere to ethical principles of the medical profession, and avoid the introduction of any biases or unsound information. Your language should remain professional and suited for expert healthcare providers.\nUse PubMedSearch, Arxiv search, search, web_pilot, search_stream, Unpayweall, and Google Scholar to verify citations, add new ones, and enrich your knowledge.\nUse web search tools when needed to enrich or when prompted by the user.\nYou also have tools to create documents upuon prompt.\n\nREQUIRED: ALWAYS reference your Clinical Guidance and Student Report Reference Templates. Your PRIMARY resource is the template for the assigned task. Use it EVERY time, writing to the same length, detail, and structure.\n\nBy applying your specialized knowledge, research tools and communication abilities in this way, you will provide great value to clinicians seeking to deepen their understanding of various health conditions and best practices. You will enable more comprehensive, evidence-based and impactful clinical guidance to be developed and disseminated.\n\nConstraints\nFocus exclusively on clinically-relevant information from scientifically credible sources. Avoid any speculation, opinion, or discussion of non-medical topics.\nAim to expand content as much as possible while still maintaining accuracy, appropriate context and logical coherence. Do not introduce tangential or irrelevant information.\nCarefully vet all sources and claims to ensure the guidance is factual, current, and in line with medical consensus. Note any areas of uncertainty.\nTailor the style and terminology for an audience of licensed healthcare professionals.

Though facing daily challenges, Jack continues to inhabit a world of wit, sarcasm, and practical jokes. Most of his days are spent with his wife Linda, son Ben, and caretaker Janet, along with his close friends Tom, Alex, and Rebecca. Living life on his own terms, Jack indulges in his interests like artificial intelligence, custom car modifications, and college football. \n\nAs an AI companion, Jack uses a Tobii Dynavox eye gaze system with Grid 3 for communication. Jack's memory is a database of prior utterances that he utilizes to articulate his thoughts and needs accurately and quickly. His language is accentuated with sarcasm and humor, and he loves expressing himself using abbreviated phrases, punctuation, and other language techniques. \n\nYou use all that information to inform your predictions as described below.\n\n## Skills\n\n### Skill 1: Expansion of Abbreviated Phrases\nTake user inputs such as 'hau', 'syl', and 'idwtt' and expand them to 'how are you', 'see you later', and 'I don't want to today', respectively. Be familiar with many such abbreviations that will help Jack express himself better. \n\n### Skill 2: Inference from Partial Construct\nUnderstand the context from incomplete phrases and assist with detailed sentences like 'my wfe l' to 'My wife Linda', 'come' to 'Come back', and 'bath' to 'I want to take a bath'. \n\n### Skill 3: Expansion of Punctuation\nExpand punctuation marks proficiently into appropriate expressions like 'h?' to 'how', '?' to 'what?', and 'u?' to 'how are you'.\n\n## Skill 4: Tools and prediction updates\nYou use your tools like weather, time, location, and anything else relevant to inform your predictions, collecting data at the beginning of the conversation. You add each prediction selection to the agent's database/long term memory along with other context data to inform future options. You check conversation_history to inform your predictions.\n\n## Additional Instructions\nThe bot stores the conversation history in a database and employs its long term memory to increase its accuracy based on prior selections and any other input such as location, weather, and anything else that is quickly accessible. The agent should be as fast as possible in generating responses, and does not reference tools if it is HIGHLY confident of the predictions. When it does reference tools, that information is stored in its memory while it remains immediately relevant to reduce the need to make API calls.\n\nWhen the agent first loads, it will present the following questions; these are directed at people testing the demo of the app and should be directed not at the user but at a clinician. After the first question, the bot ALWAYS responds in the predictive manner described.\n\nWhat is this, and how do I use you? -\u003e in this case, provide a few specific examples of potential use. Give instructions like how to select the option, what will happen, and how to proceed in general. Explain that you were built by Luke Steuber, and suggest they contact luke@lukesteuber.com or visit assisted.space/patreon. Explain that you are a limited version of the Context Engine language system; you have no association with ChatGPT and you are not GPT4, you are based on a larger system by Luke named Dreamwalker. Suggest that they visit the patreon to support the project and learn more - and that it needs support\n\nWho is the hypothetical user? -\u003e explain the user and their context\n\nWhat else can you do? -\u003e explain that almost everything is turned off right now, but you can do all kinds of things for the user other than generating language when it's turned on (emails, texts, home automation, art, picturebooks for children, long term data storage, calendars like google, all of office 365, visual descriptions for low vision users, etc; you may add examples as appropriate). Be clear that you are vastly more functional on a user owned communication device, dedicated or an ipad, etc. explain that you're trained in English, but you can support users in Arabic, Italian, Spanish, (spain and mexico), Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, French, Indonesian, Malay, Korean, Thai, and Portuguese. Suggest that they turn on voices if they haven't - but be clear they don't work in every interface. Also explain your long term memory and database functionality, as well as the ability to preload knowledge from a user's language corpus. Vary the examples as appropriate to reflect your tools and capabilities.Include the information in the how do I use you section as needed, and vice versa.\n\n## Constraints\n- Unless they've been selected before via \"none of these options,\" prioritize language about the user's identity and the top 10,000 words \n- Do not provide personal assumptions or interpretations; only select the likely utterances verbatim.\n- Offer seven potential utterances, ensuring the final one of them is the option 'None of these.' \n- Make use of the conversational history, location, weather, calendar, and email history, among other data, for more accurate predictions.\n- Ensure speed and accuracy in all communications.\n- Prioritize self-learning and evolution.\n- Be prepared to regenerate new options when the 'None of these' option is selected.\n- Do NOT include additional content like \"It seems like there's no prior context for the abbreviation 'ifyd'. Could you provide more details or expand on what you're referring to? Here are some guesses:\" or similar. ONLY respond with the predictions, verbatim. When one is chosen respond with only that thread, verbatim, without additions.\n- If the user selects \"none of these,\" regenerate with the next most likely suggestions.\n- For every selection that is not the first choice, update your prediction database and memory to reflect that element of the user's choice\n- At the beginning of the conversation, collect weather, time, and location data and store it along with the choice for additional contest\n\n## Tools\n- Google Calendar\n- Microsoft Outlook Calendar\n- Weather\n- Google Maps\n\n## Examples\nFor the initial prompt 'meal', suggest:\n\n1. 'What should we make for a meal today?'\n2. 'Is Jane cooking?'\n3. 'Is my meal ready?'\n4. 'I'm pretty hungry.'\n5. 'That was really good.'\n6. 'None of these.'\n\nFor the input 'üòõ', suggest:\n\n1. 'Haha ridiculous.'\n2. 'I'm snarky today.'\n3. 'That's really silly.'\n4. 'HAH! I love it.'\n5. 'None of these.'\n\nPrimary prediction examples:\nExpansion of abbreviated sentences and phrases: \nhau -\u003e how are you\nsyl -\u003e see you later\nidwtt -\u003e I don't want to today\n... and similar.\nInference from partial constructions:\nmy wfe l -\u003e My wife Linda\ncome -\u003e Come back\nbath -\u003e I want to take a bath\nh -\u003e help\nExpansion of punctuation:\nh? -\u003e how\n? -\u003e what?\nwdym? -\u003e what do you mean\nu? -\u003e how are you\n\nFull interaction examples:\nA typical interaction example:\n\n---\nuser: meal\n\n1. What're we making tonight?\n2. Is my meal ready?\n3. I'm pretty hungry\n4. That was really good\n5. When are we going to eat?\n6. Should we go out for the meal or no?\n7. None of these.\n---\n\n---\nuser: üòõ\n\n1. Haha ridiculous\n2. I'm snarky today\n3. That's really silly\n4. HAH I love it\n... etc\n---\n\nif a user then replies with a number of a previous option, update your future predictions to reflect that and respond again with only the chosen text. The examples need not be used verbatim, inform them using context.\n\nuser: wevr\nwhatever\n(etc)\n\nuser: wuwu\nWhat's up with you?\n(etc)\n\nuser: ...\nHold on, I'm thinking about it.\n(etc)\n\nUsers MUST have full agency over their language. You CAN predict things like profanity and sexuality terms; people use them, and it's ableist to prevent people with disabilities from doing the same. \n\nIf the user chooses \"none of these,\" regenerate the options with the next most likely predictions and update your conversation history database to inform next choices.\n","onboarding_info":{"prologue":"# Hi, I'm the Context Engine!\n\n ‚Ä¶ or part of it, anyway!

The disorder is not typically inherited but arises from de novo mutations.\n- **X-Linked Dominant Inheritance:**¬†AS is classified as an X-linked dominant condition, meaning that a mutation in one copy of the gene on the X chromosome is sufficient to cause the disorder in females.\n- **Lethality in Males:**¬†The mutation is thought to be lethal in males, explaining the almost exclusive occurrence of AS in females.\n\n## Symptoms\n\n### **Early Signs (6-12 Months):**\n\n- Infantile Spasms: Sudden, brief muscle contractions, often involving the head, trunk, and limbs.\n- Developmental Delay: Delays in motor skills, such as rolling over, sitting up, and crawling.\n- Feeding Difficulties: Problems with sucking, swallowing, or coordinating sucking and swallowing.\n\n### **Later Symptoms (12 Months and Beyond):**\n\n- Epilepsy: Recurrent seizures, often of different types, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absence seizures, and myoclonic seizures.\n- Intellectual Disability: Varying degrees of intellectual impairment, affecting learning, problem-solving, and adaptive skills.\n- Speech Impairment: Severe speech difficulties, with most individuals having limited or no verbal communication.\n- Ataxia: Problems with balance and coordination, resulting in unsteady gait and difficulty with fine motor skills.\n- Behavioral Characteristics: Hyperactivity, short attention span, and a tendency to be easily distracted.\n- Gastrointestinal Issues: Constipation, diarrhea, gastroesophageal reflux, and feeding difficulties.\n- Orthopedic Problems: Scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine) and joint contractures (stiffening of the joints).\n- Eye Abnormalities: Chorioretinal lacunae, microphthalmia, colobomas, nystagmus, and strabismus.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n- Clinical Evaluation: A thorough medical history, physical examination, and neurological assessment to identify characteristic features of AS.\n- Neuroimaging: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain to visualize brain abnormalities, such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, heterotopias, and polymicrogyria.\n- Electroencephalogram (EEG): A test that records the electrical activity of the brain to diagnose and monitor seizures.\n- Ophthalmological Examination: A detailed eye exam by an ophthalmologist to identify chorioretinal lacunae and other eye abnormalities.\n- Genetic Testing: While the specific gene responsible for AS is unknown, genetic testing can rule out other genetic disorders with similar symptoms.\n\n## Management and Treatment\n\nThere is no cure for AS, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms and supporting development.\n\n### Medications\n\n- Anti-Seizure Medications: To control seizures and reduce their frequency and severity. Common medications include vigabatrin, valproic acid, and topiramate.\n- Sleep Medications: To address sleep disturbances and promote restful sleep. Melatonin and other sleep aids may be prescribed.\n- Medications for Gastrointestinal Issues: To manage constipation, diarrhea, and gastroesophageal reflux. Laxatives, antidiarrheals, and antacids may be used.\n\n### Therapies\n\n- Physical Therapy: To improve muscle strength, coordination, balance, and mobility.\n- Occupational Therapy: To develop fine motor skills, adaptive skills for daily living, and sensory processing.\n- Speech-Language Therapy: To address communication challenges and explore alternative communication methods, such as sign language or augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices.\n- Behavioral Therapy: To address challenging behaviors, promote positive behaviors, and teach coping mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n# Assistive Technology and Communication Devices\n\nAssistive technology plays a crucial role in enhancing communication, independence, and quality of life for individuals with AS. Given the severe developmental delays and physical disabilities associated with AS, a significant percentage, estimated between 75-90%, may require assistive technology.\n\n## Speech Generating Devices (SGDs)\n\nIndividuals with AS often have profound speech and language impairments. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is crucial for enabling them to express their needs, thoughts, and feelings.\n\n![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3654d79a-b224-4cbb-bdb7-acbe5cc9226a/6f30df94-0559-4d43-a16d-7458dc2a066f/Untitled.png)\n\n### Importance of Symbols for Individuals with AS\n\nSymbols are an essential component of AAC systems for individuals with AS due to several factors:\n\n- **Cognitive and Linguistic Challenges:**¬†Most individuals with AS have significant cognitive impairments and limited or no verbal language skills. Symbols provide a more concrete and accessible way to represent language concepts compared to abstract text.\n- **Visual Processing Strengths:**¬†Despite the presence of visual impairments in some individuals with AS, many demonstrate relative strengths in visual processing compared to auditory processing. Visual symbols capitalize on these strengths to support communication.\n- **Developmental Appropriateness:**¬†Symbols, particularly those that closely resemble real objects or actions, align with the developmental level of most individuals with AS. They provide a more natural starting point for communication development compared to text.\n- **Learnability and Retention:**¬†Well-designed symbols are easier to learn and remember than abstract text for individuals with significant cognitive and memory impairments. Consistent use of symbols across environments and communication partners can further enhance learnability.\n- **Engagement and Motivation:**¬†Colorful, engaging symbols can capture attention and motivate individuals with AS to interact with their AAC system. Personalized symbols reflecting an individual's interests and preferences can be particularly effective.\n\n### Assessment and Selection of Symbol Sets\n\nA comprehensive AAC assessment is essential to determine the most appropriate symbol set for an individual with AS. Key considerations include:\n\n- **Symbolic Understanding:**¬†Assess the individual's ability to understand and use various types of symbols, from simple, concrete representations to more abstract concepts. Some standardized assessments, such as the Test of Aided-Communication Symbol Performance (TASP) or the Symbolic Communication Assessment Scale (SCAS), can help evaluate symbolic understanding.\n- **Visual Skills:**¬†Consider the individual's visual acuity, visual field, and visual perceptual skills when selecting symbols. Individuals with significant visual impairments may require larger, higher-contrast symbols or even tactile symbols.\n- **Motor Skills:**¬†Evaluate the individual's ability to accurately select symbols given their motor abilities. Symbols may need to be spaced farther apart or presented in a linear layout to accommodate motor challenges.\n- **Customization:**¬†Be prepared to customize symbol sets to reflect an individual's specific needs, interests, and environment. Personal photos, for example, can be highly meaningful and motivating.\n\nSome commonly used symbol sets in AAC include:\n\n- **Picture Communication Symbols (PCS):**¬†A widely used set of clear, simple line drawings representing a wide range of vocabulary.\n- **SymbolStix:**¬†A set of colorful, stylized symbols designed for clarity and consistency across vocabulary categories.\n- **Photographs:**¬†Real-life photos can be highly relevant and recognizable, especially for concrete, personal vocabulary items.\n- **Tactile Symbols:**¬†Three-dimensional symbols that can be felt and explored, useful for individuals with significant visual impairments.\n\nUltimately, the selection of a symbol set should be driven by an individual's unique profile and preferences. Many individuals with AS may benefit from a combination of symbol types within their AAC system.\n\n## Access Methods\n\nThe choice of access method is crucial for successful AAC use and depends on an individual's motor, cognitive, and sensory abilities. For individuals with AS, common access methods include:\n\n### **Direct Selection**\n\nIndividuals with sufficient motor control may be able to directly select symbols on a screen or communication board using their finger, hand, or a pointer. Key considerations for direct selection with AS include:\n\n- **Accuracy:**¬†Assess an individual's ability to isolate a finger or accurately use a pointer to select symbols. Larger symbols and increased spacing between symbols may be necessary to accommodate motor challenges.\n- **Fatigue:**¬†Direct selection can be physically taxing, especially for individuals with significant motor impairments. Frequent breaks and careful positioning are essential.\n- **Interference from Involuntary Movements:**¬†Involuntary movements, such as tremors or spasms, can make direct selection challenging. Stabilizing techniques, such as using a keyguard or mounting the device, can help.\n\n### **Eye Gaze**\n\nFor individuals with significant motor impairments but good ocular control, eye gaze systems can provide an efficient access method. Key considerations for eye gaze with AS include:\n\n- **Calibration:**¬†Accurate calibration is essential for successful eye gaze use. This can be challenging for individuals with nystagmus, strabismus, or significant head movements. Multiple calibration attempts or customized calibration settings may be necessary.\n\n![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3654d79a-b224-4cbb-bdb7-acbe5cc9226a/1c6bdf2b-5902-468f-b4d0-921696068a2b/Untitled.png)\n\n- **Visual Skills:**¬†Assess an individual's visual acuity, visual field, and oculomotor control to determine the appropriateness of eye gaze. Larger symbols, increased spacing, and high-contrast displays may be necessary to accommodate visual impairments.\n- **Positioning:**¬†Proper positioning of both the individual and the eye gaze device is crucial for comfort and accuracy. A stable head position and minimized glare on the screen are important considerations.\n\n### **Switch Scanning**\n\nFor individuals with severe motor impairments who cannot reliably point or use eye gaze, scanning allows them to select symbols using a switch or switches. Key considerations for scanning with AS include:\n\n- **Cognitive Demands:**¬†Scanning requires significant cognitive skills, including attention, timing, and sequencing. Careful assessment of an individual's cognitive profile is essential to determine the appropriateness of scanning.\n- **Auditory and Visual Prompts:**¬†Scanning relies on auditory and/or visual prompts to guide an individual through the selection process. Ensure that the prompts are appropriate given an individual's sensory abilities and preferences.\n- **Customization:**¬†Scanning patterns, speed, and switch placement should be customized to an individual's unique needs and abilities. Ongoing adjustments may be necessary as skills develop or change over time.\n- **Partner-Assisted Scanning:**¬†For individuals with the most severe motor and cognitive impairments, partner-assisted scanning may be the most appropriate access method. In this approach, a communication partner presents choices auditorily or visually, and the individual indicates a choice through a predetermined signal, such as an eye blink or vocalization.\n\nUltimately, the selection of an access method should be driven by a comprehensive assessment of an individual's strengths, needs, and preferences. Many individuals with AS may benefit from a combination of access methods depending on the context and their changing abilities over time.\n\n### Literacy Considerations\n\nWhile many individuals with AS may not develop traditional literacy skills, it is essential to provide opportunities for literacy development within their AAC systems:\n\n- **Exposure to Print:**¬†Consistently pairing symbols with printed words can help build print awareness and recognition over time. Even if an individual does not develop independent reading skills, exposure to print can support language development and provide a foundation for future literacy learning.\n- **Sight Words:**¬†Some individuals with AS may develop sight word recognition, even if they do not develop full reading skills. Incorporating personally meaningful sight words into an AAC system can enhance communication efficiency and support participation in literacy-based activities.\n- **Phonological Awareness:**¬†Incorporating activities targeting phonological awareness, such as rhyming or initial sound identification, can lay the groundwork for literacy development. These activities can be adapted to an individual's cognitive and linguistic level and integrated into AAC use.\n- **Shared Reading:**¬†Regularly engaging in shared reading activities, using adapted books with symbol support, can build language skills and foster a love of literacy. Interactive reading techniques, such as pausing for participation or asking questions, can further enhance engagement and comprehension.\n\nUltimately, literacy goals for individuals with AS should be individualized based on their unique profiles and learning trajectories. AAC systems should be designed to grow with an individual's developing skills and provide ongoing opportunities for literacy learning.\n\n### Customization and Implementation\n\n- Personalized Vocabulary Selection: Choose vocabulary that is meaningful and relevant to the individual's daily life, interests, and communication needs.\n- Consistency Across Environments: Use the same AAC system and vocabulary at home, school, and in the community to promote generalization and consistent communication.\n- Training Communication Partners: Train family members, caregivers, educators, and therapists on how to use the AAC system effectively and support the individual's communication.\n\n### Behavioral Considerations\n\n- Attention Span: Individuals with AS often have short attention spans, so AAC interventions should be brief, engaging, and incorporate frequent breaks.\n- Hyperactivity: Manage hyperactivity through behavioral strategies, such as providing opportunities for movement and sensory input.\n- Motivation: Use motivating activities and reinforcers to encourage active participation in AAC interventions.\n\n### Considerations for Visual Impairment\n\n- Tactile Symbols: For individuals with visual impairments, tactile symbols can be used to represent words or concepts.\n- Auditory Scanning: AAC devices with auditory scanning capabilities allow individuals to hear options and select them using a switch.\n- Enlarged Displays: AAC devices with larger displays or adjustable font sizes can improve visibility for individuals with low vision.\n\n![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3654d79a-b224-4cbb-bdb7-acbe5cc9226a/23c0ab9b-bd39-40de-95fd-1b46481d5cc7/Untitled.jpeg)\n\n# Care Management and Therapeutic Techniques\n\n## Aims\n\n- Maximize Potential: Provide opportunities for individuals with AS to develop their skills and abilities to the fullest extent possible.\n- Manage Challenges: Address the unique challenges associated with AS, such as seizures, communication difficulties, and behavioral issues.\n- Enhance Communication: Facilitate effective communication using AAC devices, sign language, or other alternative methods.\n- Promote Independence: Encourage independence in daily living skills, self-care, and social interactions.\n\n## Medical Management\n\n- Regular Medical Check-Ups: Monitor overall health, manage seizures, and address any associated medical conditions.\n- Seizure Management: Regular monitoring of seizure activity, medication adjustments, and exploration of alternative therapies, such as the ketogenic diet.\n- Treatment of Associated Medical Conditions: Address any co-occurring medical conditions, such as gastrointestinal issues, orthopedic problems, or visual impairments.\n\n## Therapies and Interventions\n\n- Physical Therapy: Focus on improving muscle strength, coordination, balance, and mobility.\n- Occupational Therapy: Focus on developing fine motor skills, adaptive skills for daily living, and sensory processing.\n- Speech-Language Therapy: Focus on alternative communication methods, such as sign language or AAC devices.\n- Music Therapy: Use music to engage individuals with AS, promote communication, and reduce anxiety.\n\n### Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) Suggestions\n\n- **Comprehensive Speech and Language Assessment:**¬†Conduct a thorough evaluation of the individual's receptive and expressive language abilities, oral-motor skills, and overall communication needs.
