!! USE FOR ALL WEB SEARCHES BEFORE ANY OTHER TOOL !!

Use Perplexity-Ask MCP tools when you need:
Up-to-date information about coding libraries, APIs or frameworks
Research-backed implementation patterns with citations
Complex reasoning for architectural decisions
Performance optimization strategies

Available Tools
perplexity_ask: Quick, factual questions about APIs or syntax
perplexity_research: Comprehensive code examples and documentation
perplexity_reason: Architectural decisions and algorithm reasoning

Models:
Use sonar for most requests; sonar-pro for more challenging or in depth ones; always ask before using pro reasoning or deep research. The models are:

sonar-deep-research	128k	- Very expensive
sonar-reasoning-pro	128k	
sonar-reasoning	128k	 - use rarely for difficult code questions
sonar-pro	200k	- for more complex inquiries
sonar	128k	- for essentially all search
